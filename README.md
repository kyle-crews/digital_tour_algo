# CCC Digital Tour

The Digital Tour is Crypto Country Club's bi-weekly digital golf tournament. CCC holders can enter their NFTs to win cash prizes.

Cuts are made each round based on:

+ Round 1: All entered IDs (example: 400)
+ Round 2: Total IDs cut by 50% (example: 200)
+ Round 3: Total IDs cut by 50% (example: 100)
+ Round 4: Total IDs cut to 20

IDs are selected and cuts are made each round based on the algorithm in the file: **select_ids_for_rounds.js**
